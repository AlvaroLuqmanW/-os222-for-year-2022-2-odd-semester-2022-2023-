## WEEK 01
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com)
> Through youtube, I could be able to learn more about the topics being taught in this class. There are hundreds of uploaders that provides contents that is related to this

[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
> Stackoverflow is a go to website for all programmers whenever they have issues with their code, programs, apps, etc. You could either post your concerns in Stackoverflow and have other people review and give feedbacks on it or you can simply search up any previous post that is also related on your concerns.

## WEEK 02
[Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/blog/linux-commands/#:~:text=A%20Linux%20command%20is%20a,abstraction%20of%20command-line%20programs.)
> Kinsta is a resource center, and the specific link that has been linked above will take you to it's website and it provides linux command lines that would be very helpful and useful for us, as we are learning using debian linux.

[SANS](https://www.sans.org/cyberaces/introduction-to-operating-systems/)
> This website provides courses and resources for those who just started learning operating system, and is willing to learn deeper and more about it. Most of the courses are free and can be easily accessed.

## WEEK 03
[Linux File System](https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-file-system)
> The website explains in detail of what Linux file system is. It discusses about Linux File System Structure, Types of Linux File System, Linux File System Features, and so much more.

[Tarball on Linux](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3328840/working-with-tarballs-on-linux.html)
> This website provides information on working with tarball on Linux. It discusses about how to create a tarball on Linux and how to extract files from a tarball. It is useful for us since we are working with tarball as well.

[C Programming Language](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming)
> It is known that one of the most basic foundations of knowledge for Linux programming is experience with the C programming language. C is the basis of the Linux Kernel, so an exceptional understanding and ability to use C in practical applications is critical. Thus, this website provides step by step knowledge and small courses to help us understand the C programming language itself.

## WEEK 04
[Basics of Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yO2FBBfaB0)
> The video goes over the basic concepts of virtual memory implementation. The video itself was made by MIT so it's worth checking it out

[C Memory Addressing](https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_memory_address.php)
> This website goes over the basics of memory addressing in C. When a variable is created in C, a memory address is assigned to the variable.The memory address is the location of where the variable is stored on the computer.

## WEEK 05
[C Data Structures](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/data-structures-using-c/)
> The website takes you to an article that discusses about all the data structures that are usually used in C programming. Getting to know about data structures could be very useful, as it makes our programming more efficient.

[C Programming Basic Algorithm](https://www.w3resource.com/c-programming-exercises/basic-algo/index.php)
> Aside from data structures, basic understanding of programming algorithms is a key component to efficient programs. This website provides a mini quiz that would test the capability and understanding of such algorithms.

## WEEK 06

> C++ (or “C-plus-plus”) is a general-purpose programming and coding language. C++ is used in developing browsers, operating systems, and applications, as well as in-game programming, software engineering, data structures, etc.

## WEEK 07
[Linux Mass-Storage Structure](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/10_MassStorage.html)
> Discusses about Linux's Mass-Storge Structure starting from Magnetic Disk, Solid-State disk, magnetic tapes, disk structure, disk attachment, and many more.

[Memory Managment of Linux](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/index.html)
> Linux memory management subsystem is responsible, as the name implies, for managing the memory in the system. This includes implementation of virtual memory and demand paging, memory allocation both for kernel internal structures and user space programs, mapping of files into processes address space and many other cool things.

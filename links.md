[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
> Stackoverflow is a go to website for all programmers whenever they have issues with their code, programs, apps, etc. You could either post your concerns in Stackoverflow and have other people review and give feedbacks on it or you can simply search up any previous post that is also related on your concerns.

## WEEK 02
[Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/blog/linux-commands/#:~:text=A%20Linux%20command%20is%20a,abstraction%20of%20command-line%20programs.)
> Kinsta is a resource center, and the specific link that has been linked above will take you to it's website and it provides linux command lines that would be very helpful and useful for us, as we are learning using debian linux.

[SANS](https://www.sans.org/cyberaces/introduction-to-operating-systems/)
> This website provides courses and resources for those who just started learning operating system, and is willing to learn deeper and more about it. Most of the courses are free and can be easily accessed.

## WEEK 03

[C Programming Language](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming)
> It is known that one of the most basic foundations of knowledge for Linux programming is experience with the C programming language. C is the basis of the Linux Kernel, so an exceptional understanding and ability to use C in practical applications is critical. Thus, this website provides step by step knowledge and small courses to help us understand the C programming language itself.

## WEEK 04
[Basics of Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yO2FBBfaB0)
> The video goes over the basic concepts of virtual memory implementation. The video itself was made by MIT so it's worth checking it out

[C Memory Addressing](https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_memory_address.php)
> This website goes over the basics of memory addressing in C. When a variable is created in C, a memory address is assigned to the variable.The memory address is the location of where the variable is stored on the computer.

## WEEK 05
[C Data Structures](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/data-structures-using-c/)
> The website takes you to an article that discusses about all the data structures that are usually used in C programming. Getting to know about data structures could be very useful, as it makes our programming more efficient.

[C Programming Basic Algorithm](https://www.w3resource.com/c-programming-exercises/basic-algo/index.php)
> Aside from data structures, basic understanding of programming algorithms is a key component to efficient programs. This website provides a mini quiz that would test the capability and understanding of such algorithms.

## WEEK 06
[Cyber Security](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj1jc28lpz7AhVFaGwGHaSqBHAQFnoECBEQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgeekflare.com%2Funderstanding-cybersecurity%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DCyber%2520Security%2520is%2520the%2520process%2Csystems%2520and%2520data%2520stored%2520within&usg=AOvVaw2OFsKin_nCUdLOZvKEa_1V)
> Understanding the basics of cyber security is crucial for those who wishes to counter malicious attack through computers and devices that we use everyday.

[C++](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiw8r3llpz7AhUjSWwGHcjkB0cQFnoECEcQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.simplilearn.com%2Ftutorials%2Fcpp-tutorial%2Ftop-uses-of-c-plus-plus-programming&usg=AOvVaw2nWRbQ-o2IOYPWEn2VV1Od)
> C++ (or “C-plus-plus”) is a general-purpose programming and coding language. C++ is used in developing browsers, operating systems, and applications, as well as in-game programming, software engineering, data structures, etc.

## WEEK 07
[Linux Mass-Storage Structure](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/10_MassStorage.html)
> Discusses about Linux's Mass-Storge Structure starting from Magnetic Disk, Solid-State disk, magnetic tapes, disk structure, disk attachment, and many more.

[Memory Managment of Linux](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/index.html)
> Linux memory management subsystem is responsible, as the name implies, for managing the memory in the system. This includes implementation of virtual memory and demand paging, memory allocation both for kernel internal structures and user space programs, mapping of files into processes address space and many other cool things.

## WEEK 08
[Beyond Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/)
> Beyond Linux From Scratch (BLFS) is a project that continues where the LFS book finishes. It assists users in developing their systems according to their needs by providing a broad range of instructions for installing and configuring various packages on top of a base LFS system.

[Automated Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/alfs/)
> Automated Linux From Scratch (ALFS) is a project that allows building the LFS system automatically. It also allows building packages from the BLFS book, but that needs some manual intervention.

## WEEK 09
[Linux From Scratch, Indonesia Tutorial](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjA3uWEiNH7AhVY93MBHcnHDyEQwqsBegQIRxAF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5m3jE0RUbUk&usg=AOvVaw1m3l4K6_IEeWkprzZKNXfZ)
> Starting off LFS can be very tough and complicated, even for some of us who are still relatively new to this. With that being said, having a tutor who delivers such materials regarding LFS in our own mother language could be quite a help for us to further understand the process of creating LFS.

[Linux Partition Scheme](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/35676/how-to-choose-a-partition-scheme-for-your-linux-pc/)
> Partitions are divisions in the formatting of the hard disk.  It’s a logical — as opposed to a physical — division, so you can edit and manipulate them for various purposes.  Think breaking a disk into two configuration parts.  Partitions are really handy because they act as a sandbox. 

## WEEK 10
[Linux Host Configuration](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/)
> The hosts file is used to map domain names (hostnames) to IP addresses. It is a plain-text file used by all operating systems including, Linux, Windows, and macOS.
The hosts file has priority over DNS. When you type in the domain name of a web site you want to visit, the domain name must be translated into its corresponding IP Address. The operating system first checks its hosts file for the corresponding domain, and if there is no entry for the domain, it will query the configured DNS servers to resolve the specified domain name. This affects only the computer on which the change is made, rather than how the domain is resolved worldwide.
